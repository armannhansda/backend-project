Middleware is software that acts as a bridge between an operating system or database and applications, especially on a network. It enables communication and data management for distributed applications. Middleware can include web servers, application servers, content management systems, and similar tools that support application development and delivery.

In the context of web development, middleware often refers to functions that process requests and responses in a web application. Middleware functions can perform a variety of tasks such as logging, authentication, error handling, and request parsing. They are typically used in frameworks like Express.js for Node.js, where they can be added to the request handling pipeline to modify or handle requests and responses.
